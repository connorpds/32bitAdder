There are only two modules in our adder; the adder itself, and the 4-bit carry look-ahead adders it is made of.

For testing the 4-bit CLAs, we simply use for-loops to iterate through all 512 possible inputs, and exit the test
prematurely with exit code 1 should there be a discrepancy between the sum calculated and the behavioral reference.

Then, we can test the 32-bit adder with the assumption that the 4-bit adders themselves work; so we only need to 
test the boundaries between each 4-bit CLA.
