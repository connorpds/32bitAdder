A large amount of the ALU consists of basic Verilog operations (logical and shifting). These we take at face
value, making sure they at least function in the ALU.

Testing the logical units was done by MAGIC.

Then, with all sub-modules tested, the ALU can be tested simply to make sure opcode selection and wiring are
correct. This is done by testing each opcode once.
