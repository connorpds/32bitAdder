A large amount of the ALU consists of basic Verilog operations (logical and shifting). These we take at face
value, making sure they at least function in the ALU.

Testing the set-if units was done by testing for negative, positive, and zero values of the adder out. This 
determines the zero flags and sign bits used by set-ifs for their decisions.

Then, with all sub-modules tested, the ALU can be tested simply to make sure opcode selection and wiring are
correct. This is done by testing each opcode once.
